# Coding-Propositional-Logic
Gutierrez, Crystal Reine E. <br><br>
This repository consists of all the needed files for the Pedantic Coding Exercise. This includes 2 files (README and ipynb) and 1 folder under the name "img" that consists of all the images used in the ipynb file. <br><br>
All the files that are in this repository are listed below:<br>
(1) A README file
(2) An img folder that consists of the flowchart diagrams in a jpeg file type.
    For Act 1 = act1 flowchart.jpeg<br>
    For Act 2 = pseudo flwchrt.jpeg<br>
(3) Two ipynb file types wherein all my final answers are in the file name "201820017_DisMath CodeLab01 - Propositional Logic"<br><br>

Note: The cells where my english statements and WFF are seems to be missing when you view it in github, but when viewing it using JupyterLab you will be able to see the cells where the WFF for activity 1 and english statement for activity 2. All of these should be under the header "Activity" when you can finally view it.<br>
Thank you for your understanding!
