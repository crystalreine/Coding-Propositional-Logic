# Coding-Propositional-Logic
Gutierrez, Crystal Reine E. <br><br>
This repository consists of all the needed files for the Pedantic Coding Exercise. This includes 4 files including the original copy of the ipynb file. <br><br>
All the files that are in this repository are listed below:<br>
(1) A README file
(2) An img folder that consists of the flowchart diagrams in a jpeg file type.
    For Act 1 = act1 flowchart.jpeg<br>
    For Act 2 = pseudo flwchrt.jpeg<br>
(3) Two ipynb file types wherein all my final answers are in the file name "201820017_DisMath CodeLab01 - Propositional Logic"<br><br>

Note: The cells where my english statements and WFF are seems to be missing when you view it in github, but when viewing it using JupyterLab you will be able<br>
to see the cells where the WFF for activity 1 and english statement for activity 2. All of these should be under the header "Activity" when you can finally view it. <br>
Thank you for your understanding!
